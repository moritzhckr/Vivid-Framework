# Vivid Framework 
Framework for simulating character animation in 3d digital buildings



Based on Unitys Navmesh system, standard rigged Character models can be used in combination with animation clips to build easy character simulations for digital buildings.
### The functionality includes:
- Spawning of characters (and character groups) in intervals or  random intervals or at a specific time. 
- Automatic wayfinding between start an destination points (Unity NavMesh).
- Creation of AnimationAreas, if a character is inside a certain area animationclips can be played.

With these functions it is possible to bring digital buildings and scenes to life.
