Based on Unitys Navmesh system standard rigged Character models can be used in combination with animation clips to build easy character simulations for digital buildings.
The functionalities includes 
- Spawning of characters (and character groups) based on random intervals or at a specific time. 
- Wayfinding between start an destination points.
- Creation of AnimationAreas, if a character is inside a certain area animationclips can be played.

With these functions it is possible to bring life to digital buildings and scenes.
